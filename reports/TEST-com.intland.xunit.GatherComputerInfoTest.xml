Which solutions / technology are supported out-of-the-box / with 3rd party components for 

1) API development - if we want to develop our own APIs

Generally we advise to use the existing REST / Swagger API.
Extending the REST API is possible using Java-based extensions implemented based on our internal Java API.


2) API consumption - if we want to consume remote APIs e.g. update requirements or add links to other systems.

Using the OSLC connector developed by our partner Mid could be the best option for this use case considering Teamcenter does support OSLC too.
Alternatively a custom integration could be developed using the Widget API (will be released with Felicity in April).
The widget API enables adding custom UI elements to the item details and document side-panel (and to many more locations in future).
Widgets can be built as a microservice using the technology-stack of your choice, that means you can use whatever technology you prefer to use to consume the remote API.

 

3) API requests - if we want to post data to remote systems.

Principally you can do that in codebeamer using Java code using additional libraries if necessary.
This can make sense if what you are trying to do is not very complex and is triggered from a Workflow Action or Listener.
If what you are trying to do is complex it could make sense to extract that into a microservice that will be called from codebeamer.
